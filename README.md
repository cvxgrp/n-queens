# n-Queens Constant

This repo accompanies the paper [_Computing Tighter Bounds on the n-Queens Constant via Newton's Method_](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/n_queens.html).

To get started with the code, clone this repo, and run `src/compute_upper_bound.py` and `src/compute_lower_bound.py` to reproduce the results from the paper.
